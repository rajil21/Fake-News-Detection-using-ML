# Fake-News-Detection-using-ML

Fake news spreads like a wildfire and this is a big issue in this era.

In this project we use machine learning algorithms to distinguish between fake news from a real one.

We use supervised learning algorithms to implement a model like this as we use labelled data set.

Finally we conclude the best supervised algorthim for this particular dataset being used.
